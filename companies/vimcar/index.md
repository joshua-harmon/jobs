  Vimcar has quickly grown to be a surprising success story within the
  multi-billion-dollar connected car industry. The startup’s flagship product, a
  mileage tracking application, has already helped over 5.000 companies to save
  thousands in taxes. But even bigger plans are ahead: Vimcar’s mission is to
  digitise and automate every aspect of fleet management for small to
  medium-size businesses, which in many cases don’t have a human fleet manager
  of their own. #auto #car #startup
