description: Elucidate is a financial crime risk quantification platform,
  regulated by the BaFin and ESMA, providing the market’s only authorised
  financial crime benchmark. We work with global financial institutions and
  regulators with the goal of identifying, minimising, and pricing their
  financial crime risk exposures, specifically focusing on money laundering,
  terror financing, and corruption risks. This is a marked contrast to the
  subjective and manual approach currently undertaken by the Global Financial
  Ecosystem to stop the flow of illicit payments.
