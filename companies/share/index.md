description: We produce high-quality beverages, food, hygiene products and
  stationery that are good for customers, good for people in need and at the
  same time as sustainable as well. In March 2018 we started to build a
  successful social consumer goods brand. So far, our concept has enabled us to
  build or repair 81 wells, distribute 11 million meals and 6.5 million hygiene
  products.
