# Creating a Roadmap to Inclusive Living

“I believe that geospatial technologies have the ability to give us a holistic view of the various factors impacting the complex problems we face today, from climate change to sustainability and livability,” says Stephanie Khoo.

Stephanie, a Principal GeoSpatial Specialist under Singapore Land Authority’s (SLA) GeoSpatial & Data Division, is a strong proponent of using geospatial technologies to solve multifaceted challenges. 

In fact, this was one of the key reasons why she joined SLA as she wanted to be part of the agency creating geospatial tech that are both innovative and useful to the public. 

Stephanie shares that she was inspired by the usefulness of tools such as OneMap 2.0 and the data made available by the agency at her previous workplace, where she was involved in engineering projects ranging from feasibility studies for hydropower plants to flood risks analysis. 

“In my previous job, I had opportunities to use OneMap 2.0 and the geospatial data made available by SLA. Example of ways in which I had used them was to gain better understanding of where the existing infrastructure was at a particular site and to plan new infrastructure around it accordingly,” she explains.

“I experienced first-hand the usefulness of easily accessible data that was made possible by SLA.”

### Better living space for all

Today, Stephanie and her team at SLA are working on using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the efficiency of collecting geospatial data. This, in turn, would lead to collecting and capturing more useful data in a timely manner that facilitates better decision-making. 

“One area we are looking into is how to make better use of hyper-local data such as the locations of stairs, lifts, escalators and shopfronts,” she says. This information provides multiple benefits to urban planners and developers and, in turn, helps members of the public to better navigate through their urban environment.

On a personal level, Stephanie hopes the work she does would go towards making Singapore a more liveable environment. 

“Location analysis of demographic data and existing infrastructure can help us identify what facilities may be missing in a particular community, whether these are green spaces, community facilities or even accessibility features,” she explains. 

> “Addressing these needs and using geospatial technologies to identify the best placement of such features can help improve the liveability of our urban environment in an inclusive and sustainable way,” she adds. 

Ultimately, she is appreciative of being in a field that challenges her daily to pick up new skills and break new ground. 

“There is never a dull moment,” says Stephanie.
