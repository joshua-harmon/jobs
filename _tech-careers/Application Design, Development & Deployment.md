	“I started off as a Consultant and was tasked to assist and support the end users operationally on government agency projects. Subsequently, I moved on to a greater role in managing and delivering new projects that arose from the Singapore Budget Announcement, specifically on Covid-19 relief package. I also had the opportunity to work on an interesting customer relationship management (CRM) project which involved multiple stakeholders and interlinking requirements between CPF systems. These projects were mostly time sensitive and often had to be delivered within short time frames. But a successful roll out of each project gives me immense satisfaction.”<br><br>
