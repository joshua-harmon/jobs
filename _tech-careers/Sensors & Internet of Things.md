### **Sensors & Internet of Things**

Harness the many possibilities Sensors and the Internet of Things (SIOT) can bring about, across anything and everything from smart homes and gardens, to large-scale assisted living ecosystems, community wellness enablers and state-of-the-art defence and public security systems. 

Our SIOT solutions improve the efficiency and efficacy of public service officers in performing city operations and delivering citizen-centric services. As a SIOT engineer, you are empowered to take charge of the end-to-end engineering process, working alongside passionate and talented engineers to build and deploy platforms and systems that scale from 1 to 1,000,000.

Join one of our many teams to implement meaningful projects that impact the nation. The Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP) connects a shared network of sensors that collects and analyses data to enable smarter decisions on city planning and the delivery of citizen-centric services. Or build the next generation surveillance and sensemaking system that is a force-multiplier for our defence and homeland security forces. Our SIOT solutions meet the needs of diverse groups – from NSmen (enhancing the NS experience through digital innovations) to the elderly (IoT Personal Alert Button) and people with special needs (eCanvas assistive technology) as well as the general populace (TraceTogether Tokens for contact tracing). There’s much more to come.
