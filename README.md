## Quickstart

Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/kfei/vue-s3-dropzone
```

This repo contains two directories: **frontend** and **lambda**. You must first
create the AWS Lambda function and deploy it onto AWS API Gateway. Then put the
invoke URL into `frontend/src/config.js` so that you can run and test the Vue
powered web client by:

```
cd frontend
yarn install
npm run dev
```

Please make sure you have correct privilege/policy/CORS settings on AWS. Feel
free to open an issue if you happened to be trapped by that. :cry:
